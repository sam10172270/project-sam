  "summary": "Past 3 weeks have been hectic. Sleep’s been trash — last night only got 3 hours again. Work pressure nonstop, manager's behavior just added to the mental load. He lashed out over a bug that wasn’t even real, didn’t own up, just redirected anger to something else. I stayed calm, didn’t react — could’ve exploded, but I held it. After the fight, brain was stable but body and nerves still drained. That said, I had a long, solid chat with ChatGPT about AI jobs. Started from a place of confusion and ended with actual direction. Figured out that AI job market is full of fluff, but there’s a niche I can own: building local, on-device tools that solve real pain in India. And from that, we refined and landed on a powerful idea: FormMate — an offline form-filling assistant for Indian users, especially middle-class/lower-income. That idea’s now locked as a secondary project. Derap stays the primary mission. Ideas are coming together, but my bandwidth is burning out. Hoping tomorrow isn't another fire."
