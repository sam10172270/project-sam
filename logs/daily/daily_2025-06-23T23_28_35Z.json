  "summary": "Today marked a psychological inflection point in Quant prep. A shift from external app-dependence to building a personalized, distraction-free, system-driven strategy. Clear rejection of dopamine-based platforms in favor of self-coded structure. Emotional and cognitive alignment started syncing again, driven by the 'clear cutoff' goal, not perfectionism. Execution momentum is still low, but clarity is high.",
