  "summary": "A calm-before-the-storm kind of day. Landed at a transitional threshold \u2014 tomorrow marks Day 1 of a new chapter. Emotions were mixed but manageable: ambient anxiety with brief stress spikes, tempered by a rational awareness that things are now moving forward. Relief is present but hasn\u2019t fully sunk in, like background music not yet noticed. Body is still processing the end of a long-wait loop. The mind is scanning ahead while the heart is catching up.",
