  "summary": "High-functioning but emotionally disconnected. Completed intense office work with sustained energy, possibly due to medication (bupropion). Mood was flat with chest ache, especially after work hours. Social detachment noted—triggered mildly by a colleague's comment about lack of laughter. No acute distress, but sense of hollowness and reduced emotional salience.",
