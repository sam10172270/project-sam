  "summary": "Continued work on the SAM project late into the night, successfully building and testing a RAG-based system with a local Mistral 7B model. Accessed results from phone via Streamlit. Felt deeply productive and energized, though sleep routine was disrupted. Slept around 4:00 a.m., woke at 10â€“11 a.m. with approximately 6 hours of rest. Maintained elevated mood and high energy throughout the day while working on the app. Aware of possible hypomanic state but maintaining control due to having Saturday free.",
